	<p>This is a great book to use as a reference. As a guide it does not show you how to make a beautiful awe-inspiring webpage. Instead it takes you through all the ins and outs of CSS technology. It starts out with the fundamental subject areas in regards to CSS and progresses into areas that are more rigorous. As far as programming languages go Meyer makes CSS seem intuitive. Meyer leaves nothing out; Everything a person needs to know about CSS is right in this book. Where this book excels over other reference books is Meyer's ability to turn an otherwise dry topic into a more appealing read. Perhaps I am biased because I previously had experience coding before I picked up this book. People new to CSS may find it unbearable. What they need to understand is that this is a comprehensive <span class="italic">guide</span> to CSS. To actually learn CSS you need to sit down at your computer and practice after seeing lots of previous examples. On another note, I especially like his presentation on units in CSS. Before this book I was kind of in the dark about what a pixel, em-height, and ex-height can be defined as.
